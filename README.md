# Cats-Dogs-Image-Classification
The problem is similar to Belgian Traffic sign problem. Here we just have 2 classes of images so itâ€™s a binary classification problem. The motivation was to use keras and CNN for modelling. Due to RAM limitation only one epoch was completed which gave accuracy of 71% which gives appositive sign that CNN should have given much better accuracy after completing the set 20 epochs. One interesting finding about keras capability was its intuitive image processing method: ImageDataGenerator which loads the images from the folders and creates training and test set with the functionality of resizing the images, normalizing and assigning classification type on the fly. It makes building the model in few lines.
